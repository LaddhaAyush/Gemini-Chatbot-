The evolution of transformers has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence, marking a remarkably positive shift from traditional sequential models like RNNs and LSTMs. Introduced by Vaswani et al. in 2017, the "Attention is All You Need" paper laid the foundation for a model that could understand long-range dependencies with parallel processing â€” a breakthrough that drastically reduced training time while improving performance. Transformers became the backbone of state-of-the-art models such as BERT, GPT, and T5, driving massive improvements in NLP, vision, and multi-modal tasks. Their scalability, transfer learning capability, and adaptability across domains have empowered a new era of intelligent systems, making them a cornerstone of modern AI innovation.
